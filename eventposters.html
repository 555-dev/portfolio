            Latest poster for Stage & Radio, created primarily in TouchDesigner, I took an image of the band and experimented with some bitmapping
             effects & movement before rigging a camera to capture the depth.

            Commissioned by Stage and Radio, the oldest grassroots music venue in Manchester, I designed a promotional poster
             for a UK Hip Hop gig. With the social media format in mind I developed a motion identity with an icon of the headliner to engage with viewers
              scrolling through their feeds. The artwork features on the social pages of the venue and artists performing, along with the ticket sales site
               Skiddle.
